# Modality-Preference
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper, Evaluating and Steering Modality Preferences in Multimodal Large Language Model.

We provide the data in $MC^2$ for evaluating modality preference and controlling modality preference through noisy images or text context with grammer errors in this repository.

The complete data of $MC^2$ can be found in [**ðŸ¤—Huggingface**](https://huggingface.co/271754echo/MC2)
